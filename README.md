# Introducing: NeuralHive
A collaborative social platform for brain health research 

NeuralHive is a collaborative platform for researchers and trainees to connect and share their work. While there are existing platforms that allow researchers to share their research papers, we recognize the significance of collaboration amongst researchers to improve brain health research. We envision the platform allowing researchers to connect based on their specializations in the brain health field and allow them to share their work through a collaborative space.

The platform will feature:

* Verified check marks to indicate profiles from leading experts in the field
* The ability to make a research focused profile highlighting your work experience, expertise, and institution.
* Public tags that indicate that you are open to mentoring, project collaboration, feedback and advice.
* Researchers and trainees will have an option to include their contact information for anyone to reach out to them with their questions or they can utilise built-in chat features.
* A feed tailored to your interests to keep you updated with the brain health community.


The overall goal of the platform is to provide a hub for researchers to interact using qualities of social media but with the added safety blanket of content coming from expert sources. NeuralHive will allow recruiters to actively see peopleâ€™s work and collaborations allowing for a more engaging and specialized recruitment process for research collaborations. Altogether, we believe this program can be revolutionary for research collaboration and are confident it will have a big impact on the research community.
